# Debugging Rails example repo

This is an example Rails repo based on a final project team's repo. Your task is to find and fix the bug

## Instructions

- Find and fix the bug!

The [debugging pill](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/debugging.md) might be of help here. Remember the goal is to find the problem rather than spend hours trying to understand exactly what's going on.
